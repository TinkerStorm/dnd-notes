# Arena Insight

> Inspired by specific events of a campaign and the arena tournament that took place that session.

- [Probability](../common/probability.md)

## DM selections

### Forfeit option

Choose if decision to forfeit is available, and if it should be decided by...

- [A dice roll](../common/probability.md#dice-roll)
- [A coin flip](../common/probability.md#coin-flip)
- _Available by default_

> Forfeit option could even be _bought_ or _bribed_ for - DM could punish with a disadvantage for [Combat knowledge](#combat-knowledge-threshold).

### Combat knowledge threshold

Advantage could be achieved through use of a select few types of attributes.

- Charasima - Decrease if successful.
  - Option: decrease **Wisdom** regardless of outcome.
- Intelligence - Increase if successful.

The above are suggested examples - mainly focusing on "mental" attributes.

> Success _or failure_ can also have knock-on affects to other attributes (as noted with the `Option:` above).

### Additional notes

#### Outcome conflicts

<!-- TODO: move to ~/common/*.md file -->

Dice rolls can be merged if they do not directly conflict with each other and condition outcomes can be reversed or flipped around.

| Dice (min) | Forfeit | Knowledge | Description | Guidance |
| ---- | ------- | --------- | ----------- | ---------- |
| `1d12` | $4n$ | $6n$ | Linear progression is not linked. Direct conflict with `12`. | Maybe, maybe not. |
| `1d4` | $2n$ | $4n$ | Knowledge can only be obtained after the forfeit is offered. | **Not advised.** |
| `1d12` | $4n$ | $>8$ | Both can only be attained with `12` at minimum. | Recommended. |

#### Applying 'effects' after insight

- The justification to **increase** on _Intellect_ would be for the player using combat tactics to adjust as needed.
  > Thereby proving themselves as a warrior able to adapt in combat.
- The justification to **decrease** on _Charsima_ would be for the player bribing the arena host, or someone of knowledgable insight.
  > As such, while the charsima may succeed an individual, it would not on observers - for the purpose of balance.
  >
  > _I don't have a narrative reason as of yet._

Attribute modification can be the DMs decision as for how rewarding / costly it is to the player, and to decide if the effect wears off with time - dependent on the **time scale** of a campaign. Attribute effects can also wear off after another specific event or encounter predefined for the campaign ahead.

#### General notes

Not sure on the direct or indirect implications it would have on a campaign, but it could be something if the odds are balanced appropriately.
